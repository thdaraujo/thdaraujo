### Hello! I'm Thiago Araujo! 👋

I'm a software engineer/entrepreneur living in Vancouver, Canada. 🏞️

I’ve been working with software development since 2010, and I’m interested in Entrepreneurship, Finance and Business, Ruby and Elixir, Software Development, AI/ML and Podcasting.

I’ve been playing with computers since my father built an Intel 80486DX2 computer in the early 90s. My first video game console was the Atari 2600.

I’m co-host of the 🎙️[hexdevs podcast](https://www.hexdevs.com/).

I write about software and business on my blog ☄️[thd.codes](https://www.thd.codes/). I love to talk about the intersection of software development + business + financial freedom.
